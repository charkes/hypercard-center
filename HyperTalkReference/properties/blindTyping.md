# blindTyping

```
set [the] blindTyping to [ph:trueOrFalse]
```

The `blindTyping` global property returns or sets whether you can type into the Message box and send messages from it even when it isn't visible.

HyperCard determines the default setting for `blindTyping` at startup (and when HyperCard resumes after being suspended) from the Blind Typing option on the Preferences card of the Home stack. 

## Examples

```
set the blindTyping to true
```
