# itemDelimiter

```
set [the] itemDelimiter to <i>char
```

</i>The `itemDelimiter` property sets or retrieves what character HyperCard uses to separate items in a list.

The default delimiter is `comma`. HyperCard resets` itemDelimiter` to the default delimiter at idle.

This property has no effect on comma-delimited structures such as `dateItems`, location `(loc`), or rectangles (`rect`).
