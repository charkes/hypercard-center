# cursor

<code>set [the] cursor to <i>cursor</i></code>

The` cursor `property sets the image that appears as the pointer on the screen.

<b>Note: </b>`cursor` is a `set`-only property. You<b> </b>cannot` get `the current value of the` cursor `from a script.

HyperCard provides a number of built-in cursors that you can use. (HyperCard automatically resets the cursor to the image for the current tool on idleâ€”when no other action is happening.)

The built-in cursors are:

* `Ibeam` (or `1`)
* `cross` (or `2`)
* `plus` (or `3`)
* `watch` (or `4`)
* `hand`
* `arrow`
* `busy`
* `none`

The` busy `cursor rotates an eighth of a turn each time you call it.

## Examples

```
set the cursor to 1
set the cursor to 4
set the cursor to Ibeam
set the cursor to none
set the cursor to watch

repeat with i = 1 to 100
  set the cursor to busy -- spins the beach ball
  ...
end repeat
```

## Demo Script

```
on rotateCursors
  repeat with cursorNumber = 1 to 4
    set the <b>cursor</b> to cursorNumber
    wait 30
  end repeat
  set the <b>cursor</b> to hand
  wait 30
  set the <b>cursor</b> to arrow
  wait 30
  set the <b>cursor</b> to balloon -- a cursor in the HyperCard Help stack
  wait 30
  repeat for 73
    set the <b>cursor</b> to busy
    wait 1
  end repeat
end rotateCursors
```
