# lockText

` set `[`the`]<code> lockText of [ph:field] Â¬     to [ph:trueOrFalse]

</code>The `lockText` property returns or sets whether the user can edit the text within a specified field. It corresponds to the Lock Text check box in a Field Info dialog box. The default value is false (meaning the field is unlocked). 

 When a field is locked, it can receive the system messages `mouseDown`,` mouseDoubleClick, mouseStillDown`, and` mouseUp` when the user clicks it.

Before a field can act as a[ph: list field],  its ` lockText `property must be set to true. 


## Examples

```
set the lockText of card field 1 to true
set the lockText of the target to false -- if the target is a field
set the lockText of me to true -- if in a field script
```
