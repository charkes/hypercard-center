# lockMessages

` set `[`the`]<code> lockMessages to [ph:trueOrFalse]

</code>The `lockMessages` property returns or sets whether HyperCard sends certain messages automatically.

The messages affected are` closeCard`,` closeBackground`,` closeStack`,` openCard`,` openBackground`,` openStack`,` resumeStack`, and` suspendStack`. 

 Setting `lockMessages` to true is useful when you want to go to a card to retrieve or save information, but you donâ€™t want to stay there. (The handler will run faster with `lockMessages` set to true.)

The default setting is false, meaning that HyperCard <u>does</u> send the messages. HyperCard sets `lockMessages` to false on idle. 


## Examples

```
set the lockMessages to true
```

## Demo Script

```
on lockMessagesDemo
  -- The script of this background contains a closeCard handler that
  -- closes this Demo Script field if it is open.
  -- By locking messages, this handler prevents HyperCard from sending
  -- the closeCard message when it goes to the previous card.
  set <b>lockmessages</b> to true
  click at the loc of bkgnd button "Prev"
  click at the loc of bkgnd button "Next"
  set <b>lockmessages</b> to false
end lockMessagesDemo
```
