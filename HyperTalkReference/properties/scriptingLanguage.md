# scriptingLanguage

 <code>set [the] scriptingLanguage Â¬      [of [ph:object ]] to <i>languageName

</code></i>where [ph:`languageName`]  is HyperTalk or the name of any OSA-compliant  scripting system such as AppleScript.

The `scriptingLanguage` property sets or retrieves  the scripting system of the object or (when you don't use ` of [ph:object] `) of the message box. 

[ph:`LanguageName `]must be present in the computer's system resources. 

 The message box and each individual object can all respond to different scripting systems.

You can also set the `scriptingLanguage` property for an object by choosing from the Scripting Language pop-up menu at the top of each object's script editor window.

The default [ph:`languageName`]  is HyperTalk.
