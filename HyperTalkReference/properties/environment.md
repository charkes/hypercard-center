# environment

`get the environment`

This read-only property returns `development` when the fully enabled version of HyperCard is running or `player` when HyperCard Player or a standalone stack is running.

(A standalone stack is an application that you create by choosing “Application” from the pop-up File Type menu in the Save a Copy dialog box.)

## Examples

```
if the environment is "player" then shutOff developerTools
```
