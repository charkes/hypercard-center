# keyDown

`keyDown [ph:char]`

The `keyDown` command simulates a key press from within a handler. It acts exactly as if the user pressed a character` `from the keyboard.

HyperCard sends the `keyDown` command to a field (if the insertion point is set) or to the current card when the user presses a key. The value passed to the parameter variable `[ph:char]` corresponds to the key pressed.

You can handle the `keyDown` message as follows:

```
on keyDown theKey
  [ph:statements]
end keyDown
```

Note: `keyDown` is not sent for characters typed using the `type` command.
