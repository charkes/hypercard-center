</code>The <code>push</code> command saves the identification of a card in HyperCardâ€™s memory. If you specify a background or stack, HyperCard stores the location of the <b>first</b> card of the background or stack.  In all cases, HyperCard saves the full card ID and the path name for the stack. 

Each call to <code>push</code> saves a card ID in last-in, first-out order. You can return to saved locations using the <code>pop</code> command.

Note: The word <code>stack</code> that forms part of the stack identifier<code> [ph:stack] </code>is optional with the <code>push</code> command.

There is a limit of twenty pushes.

If you <code>pop</code> more than you<code> push</code>, you go to the Home stack. 


## Examples

```
push card
push this card
push next card
push recent card -- remember where you've been
push card 234 of this stack

push first card of stack "Home"
push first card of "Home"

push background "Index" of stack "Glossary"
push background "Index" of "Glossary"

push stack "Home"
push "Home"
```
