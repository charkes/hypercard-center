# debug

```
debug checkPoint
```

The `debug checkPoint` command sets a permanent checkpoint in a HyperTalk handler. When HyperCard runs a handler, the `debug checkpoint` command causes HyperCard to enter the debugger; it pauses execution of the handler and opens a script editor window with a box around the line with the checkpoint.

This command works only when the `userlevel` property is set to 5.
