# multiply

```
multiply [[ph:chunk] of] [ph:container] Â¬
     by [ph:number]
```

where [ph:container] or [ph:chunk] must contain a number. (You can use the `is a` operator to see if the container is a number.)

The `multiply` command multiplies the number in the container or chunk by `[ph:number]` and puts the result into the container or chunk. The result is calculated to a precision of up to 19 decimal places.

The result is displayed in a field or the Message box according to the global property `numberFormat`.

## Examples

```
multiply field "Total" by 100
multiply line 10 of theTotal by (the number of lines of theTotal)

if theTotal is a number then multiply theTotal by theNumberOfEntries
```
