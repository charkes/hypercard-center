# HyperTalk and scripts

HyperTalk® is HyperCard’s script language. You use it to write English-like statements that respond to events (such as when the user clicks a button or goes to a new card).

In HyperTalk, responding to an event is called <b>handling</b> the event. As a scripter, you write a specific handler for each event that you want your stack to handle. A collection of handlers is called a script.

The following graphic shows a handler for the <code>mouseUp</code> event. It’s part of the script of card button id 1.
