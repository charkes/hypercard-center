# Handling messages

As a scripter, you write message handlers to respond to messages. When an object receives a message, HyperCard searches the objectâ€™s script for a handler with the same name (a handler starts with the word <code>on</code> followed by the name of a message). If HyperCard finds a match, it runs any HyperTalk statements in the handler until it hits an <code>end</code> statement.

For example, if you want a button to respond to a <code>mouseUp</code> message, you would add a <code>mouseUp</code> message handler to its script.
