```

Values returned:

* for `the selectedLine`, a line expression that indicates the line of a field or the Message box in which a range of characters is currently highlighted

* for `the selectedLine of [ph:listField]`, a line expression that indicates the     lines of a <i>list field</i> in which the characters are currently highlighted

```
line <i>i</i> of {card|bkgnd} field <i>n</i>
line <i>i</i> of {card|bkgnd} button <i>n</i>
line <i>x</i> to <i>y</i> of {card|bkgnd} field <i>n</i>
```

where `[ph:i]` is the line number and `[ph:n]` is the number of a popup button or a  field, and `[ph:x]` to `[ph:y]` is a range of lines in a <i>list field</i>.
