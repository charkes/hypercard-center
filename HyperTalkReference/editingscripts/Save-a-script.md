# Save a script

 Once you have made changes to a script, you can save it in two ways:

• To save a script without closing its     script window, choose Save Script     from the File menu (or press Command-S).

• To save a script and close its script      window, press Enter. 


When you close an unsaved script's window by any method other than pressing Enter, HyperCard asks if you want to save the changes.
