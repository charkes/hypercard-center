# suspend

`suspend`

Handler:

```
on suspend
  [ph:statements]
end suspend
```

HyperCard sends the `suspend` message to the current card when a user (or handler) launches an application from HyperCard with the `open` command, just before the application is launched.

Note: HyperCard does not send this message when itâ€™s running under MultiFinder.
