# closeBackground

`closeBackground`

Handler:

```
on closeBackground
   [ph:statements]
end closeBackground
```

HyperCard sends the `closeBackground` message to the current card when a user (or handler) quits HyperCard, goes to a card whose background is different from the background of the current card, and when a background or stack is deleted.
