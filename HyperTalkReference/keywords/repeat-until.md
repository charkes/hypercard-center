# repeat until

```
repeat until [ph:trueOrFalse]
   [ph:statements]
end repeat
```

The statements in a `repeat until` structure repeat as long as the condition following the word `until` is false. HyperCard checks the condition before the first and any subsequent iterations of the loop.

If HyperCard executes an `exit repeat` statement in the loop, it continues running the handler starting from the first statement after `end repeat`.

If HyperCard executes a `next repeat` statement, it returns immediately to the beginning of the `repeat` loop.

## Demo Script

```
on mouseUp
  show bkgnd field "demo field"
  put return & "    Point at the number to stop counting..." Â¬
  into bkgnd field "demo field"
  put 0 into theCount
  put space & space & theCount after bkgnd field "demo field"
  <b>repeat until</b> the mouseLoc is within "321,81,370,110"
    add 1 to theCount
    put theCount into last word of bkgnd field "demo field"
    if theCount = 100 then exit repeat -- just in case.
  <b>end repeat</b>
  wait 20
  hide bkgnd field "demo field"
  put empty into bkgnd field "demo field"
end mouseUp
```
