# exit

```
exit repeat
exit [ph:functionName]
exit [ph:messageName]
exit to HyperCard
```

The `exit` keyword interrupts the current flow of control.

`Exit repeat` sends control to the end of a `repeat` structure, ending execution of the loop regardless of the state of the controlling conditions.

The `exit [ph:functionName]` and `exit [ph:messageName]` forms stop the current message or function handler. Control returns to any pending statements from another handler, if any.

`Exit to HyperCard` terminates all running or pending handlers and cancels all pending messages.

Using `exit` to leave a function handler sets the value of the function to empty.

## Examples

```
if N = 0 then exit repeat

if it is empty then exit mySave

if there is no card field "Index" then exit indexFunction

-- In the following example, the openCard message will not occur as the
-- user goes from card to card:

on closeCard
  flash
  exit to HyperCard
end closeCard

on openCard
  beep
end openCard

-- The newButton message will occur because HyperCard sends it before
-- the exit to HyperCard:

on anExample
  doMenu "New Button" -- creates a new button, sends newButton message
  exit to HyperCard
end anExample

on newButton
  beep
end newButton
```

## Demo Script

```
on exitDemo
  answer "Would you like to see a demo?" with "No" or "Yes"
  if it is "No" then exit exitDemo
  put "Click the mouse to exit this handlerâ€¦"
  put 1 into lineNum
  put the number of lines in me into totalLines
  set the autoSelect of me to true -- to get a nice solid hilite
  repeat
    if lineNum > totalLines then put 1 into lineNum
    select line lineNum of me
    if the mouseClick then <b>exit</b> <b>repeat</b>
    add 1 to lineNum
  end repeat
  wait 20
  select line 0 of me
  set the autoSelect of me to false
end exitDemo
```
