# repeat while

<code><pre>
repeat while <i>trueOrFalse</i>
   <i>statements</i>
end repeat
</pre></code>

<br>
The statements in a <code>repeat while</code> structure repeat as long as the condition following the word<code> while </code>is true. HyperCard checks the condition before the first and any subsequent iterations of the loop.<br>
<br>
If HyperCard executes an<code> exit repeat </code>statement in the<code> </code>loop, it continues running the handler starting from the first statement after<code> end repeat</code>.<br>
<br>
If HyperCard executes a<code> next repeat </code>statement, it returns immediately to the beginning of the<code> repeat </code>loop.<br>
