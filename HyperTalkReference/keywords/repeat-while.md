# repeat while

```
repeat while <i>trueOrFalse</i>
   <i>statements</i>
end repeat
```

The statements in a `repeat while` structure repeat as long as the condition following the word `while` is true. HyperCard checks the condition before the first and any subsequent iterations of the loop.

If HyperCard executes an `exit repeat` statement in the loop, it continues running the handler starting from the first statement after `end repeat`.

If HyperCard executes a `next repeat` statement, it returns immediately to the beginning of the `repeat` loop.

## Demo Script

  show bkgnd field "demo field"
