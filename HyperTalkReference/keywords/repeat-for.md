# repeat for

```
repeat [for] [ph:posInteger] [times]
   [ph:statements]
end repeat
```

The statements in a `repeat for` structure repeat for a specified number of times.

If HyperCard executes an `exit repeat` statement in the loop, it continues running the handler starting from the first statement after `end repeat`.

If HyperCard executes a `next repeat` statement, it returns immediately to the beginning of the `repeat` loop.

## Demo Script
