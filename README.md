# hypercard-center

Data repository for HyperCard's HyperTalk Reference.

This data is pulled from the HyperTalk Reference stack included with HyperCard 2.4. The content of the stack was exported to JSON using [HyperCardPreview](https://github.com/PierreLorenzi/HyperCardPreview) and then custom translation software attempts to reformat the cards into MarkDown (with a few extended tidbits).

The viewer for this repository's data will be available at [HyperCard Center](https://hypercard.center/) once I've had a chance to rewrite the website side.
