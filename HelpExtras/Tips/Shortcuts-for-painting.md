### Shortcuts for painting

You can use the following shortcuts while you’re using a Paint tool:

* To undo your most recent action,     press Esc or ~ (Tilde).

* To go back to a card you’ve visited,     press Command-Esc or Command-~ (Command-Tilde).

* To see just the card picture, close the     Message box if it’s visible, and     press Option-D.

* To see all areas of the card or background    picture that are opaque, close the     Message box if it’s visible, and     press Option-O. (Opaque graphics require    more room than transparent graphics.)

* To show and hide the Patterns palette,     press Tab.

* To show and hide the Tools palette,     press Option-Tab.

* To peel off a copy of a graphic, select it     and Option-drag. The copy  remains in     the same layer (card or  background) as      the original.

* The Brush and the Spray tools will erase     if you hold down the Command key while    using them.
