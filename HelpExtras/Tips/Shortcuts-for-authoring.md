### Shortcuts for authoring

You can use the following shortcuts while you author your own stacks:

* To paste a button or field along with its      text, press Command-Shift-V after copying or      cutting the object. If the object is a      background field,  only the text from the     current card is pasted. ```
```

* To open the Button Info dialog box,      double-click a button when the Button      tool is chosen.

* To open the Field Info dialog box,      double-click a field when the Field tool      is chosen.

* To create a new button or field, choose      the appropriate tool, and Command-drag      diagonally.

* To peel off a copy of a button, field, or     graphic, select the desired element, and     option-drag. The copy remains in the     same domain (card or background) as the    original.

* To peek at all the buttons or fields (even     ones that are hidden), choose the     appropriate tool, and press Command-Option.

* To delete the current card,      press Command-Delete.

* To paste a miniature image (paint) of a     card, choose Copy Card and then press    Command-Shift-V. To paste a full-sized image     (paint) of a card, hold down Option, and     choose Copy Card; then press    Command-Shift-V.

* To show or hide the Tools palette, press      Option-Tab.

* To show or hide the Patterns palette,      choose any Paint tool, and press Tab.
