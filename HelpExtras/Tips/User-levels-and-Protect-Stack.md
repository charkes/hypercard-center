### User levels and Protect Stack

Both the user level set on the Preferences card of the Home stack <b>and</b> the user level set in a stack’s Protect Stack dialog box determine the commands a user has access to while using the stack.

When these two settings are different, HyperCard uses the lower of the two settings. (Lower means “closer to Browsing.”)
