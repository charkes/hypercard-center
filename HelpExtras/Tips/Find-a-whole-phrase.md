### Find a whole phrase

To find only whole words (that is, to exclude partial matches), press Command-Shift-F to display the Message box with the `find whole` command.

For example, `find whole "Apple Computer"` succeeds only if HyperCard finds that exact string, including the space.  (That is, the words must appear in order.)  It won’t find “Apple Computers” or “This apple is a computer.” (The regular `find` command would match all three cases.)
