### Power keys for Paint tools

When Power Keys on the Options menu is checked and the Message box is hidden, you can use the keyboard to choose items on the Paint, Options, and Patterns menus while certain Paint tools are active. (If the Message box is visible, pressing a key just types into the Message box).

Power Keys is also an option on the Preferences card of your Home stack. Go there to select it if you always want to use the Power Keys option.
