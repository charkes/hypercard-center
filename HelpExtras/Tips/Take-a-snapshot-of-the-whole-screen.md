### Take a snapshot of the whole screen

To take a quick snapshot of everything on the screen, including the menu bar and any tear-off menus, press Command-Shift-3.  This keyboard command is built into your Macintoshâ€™s System file and is available at any time.

When you save a picture of the screen under System 6, the picture gets the name [ph:screen] [ph:`n `]where [ph:`n `]is a number from 0 through 9.

Under System 7, Command-Shift-3 saves a picture of the screen under the name [ph:picture n] where [ph:`n `]is a number from 0 through 99.

You can also use this shortcut in almost any Macintosh program and import the picture into HyperCard with the Import Paint command.
