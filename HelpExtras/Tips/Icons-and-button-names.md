### Icons and button names

* You can assign an icon to a button and 
   choose to display the buttonâ€™s name. 
   When you do so,  the name appears 
   centered below the icon in 9-point 
   Geneva.  HyperCard overrides the  
   existing text format of the name.

* HyperCard does not display icons for 
    check boxes or radio buttons.

* You cannot assign an icon to a pop-up
    button.
