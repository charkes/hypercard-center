### Draw filled shapes

To fill a shape automatically with the currently selected pattern in the Patterns menu as you draw the shape, turn on the Draw Filled option. You may either:

* choose Draw Filled from the Options menu; or

* double-click the Rectangle, Round Rectangle, Oval, Curve, or Polygon tool.

These five tools as well as the Regular Polygon tool on the Tools palette fill with gray to indicate that Draw Filled is on.
