### Constrain drawing to a grid

Choose Grid from the Options menu (or press G if the Power Keys option is turned on) to constrain the movement of the pointer to an invisible grid while youâ€™re using the Paint tools.

When Grid is turned on, any graphics you create or drag will be aligned to the grid. The lines in the grid are eight pixels apart.

The Grid option does not affect drawing done with the Curve, Eraser, Brush, Pencil, Spray, or Bucket tool.
