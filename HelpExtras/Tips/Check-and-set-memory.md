### Check and set memory

To check your system version and total memory, go to the Finder™ and choose About This Computer from the Apple menu. (In earlier system versions,  this item reads “About the Finder” or “About This Macintosh.”)

The dialog box that appears will show you the version of the System (which should be 6.0.5 or later) and the total memory your machine has (which should be at least 2048K; 4096K, if you are running System 7; or 8192K on a Power Macintosh computer).

If you’re running MultiFinder or System 7, you can assign more memory to HyperCard before you launch it from the Finder by clicking the HyperCard icon once to select it and then choosing Get Info from the File menu. At the bottom of the Get Info box, you’ll see an editable text field called “Preferred Size,” “Application Memory Size,” or something similar (depending on the system version). Type a number into the box (for example, type 2000 to give HyperCard 2000K of memory).
