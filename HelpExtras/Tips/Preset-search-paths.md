### Preset search paths

When you tell HyperCard to open or print a stack, application, or document, it follows its own preset search paths to find the file in the following order:

1.  the folder that contains the 
     current stack
2.  the folder that contains HyperCard
3.  the top level of the current disk
4.  the appropriate Search Paths card in 
     the Home stack for other paths to check
