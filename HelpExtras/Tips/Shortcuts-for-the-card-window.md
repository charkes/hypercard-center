### Shortcuts for the card window

You can use the following shortcuts to resize and scroll the card window:

* To zoom the card window to full size     and center it on the screen, double-click     inside the Scroll window. (Choose Scroll     from the Go menu to see the     Scroll window).

* To resize the card window and scroll     around the card directly, press Command-Shift-E.     A size box appears in the lower-right     corner of the window, and the current     tool temporarily changes into a hand:

   - Drag the size box to resize the window;       grab and drag with the hand to scroll       the card within the window.

   - To constrain the scrolling or resizing       to a horizontal or vertical direction,       hold down the Shift key.

<b>   - </b>Press and hold the Command key while you       drag to resize and scroll continuously.       Otherwise, the size box and hand       disappear after you press and release the      mouse button once.
