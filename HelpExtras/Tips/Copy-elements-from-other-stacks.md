### Copy elements from other stacks

Copying fields, buttons, and graphics from other stacks can make stack building easier and can save you a lot of time. If you see a button that does something you like, or you find an attractive background picture  you’d like to use, copy it and paste it into your stack.   

Some of the stacks that come with HyperCard—Readymade Buttons, Readymade Fields, Art Bits, Background Art, and Stack Templates—contain ready-made graphics and parts that you can use in your stacks.

Note: When you copy an object from one place to another, you copy its script too (if it has one) and, with cards, any scripts associated with the buttons and fields on the card. 

Because scripts sometimes rely upon specific elements in a stack, you might encounter problems (such as unfamiliar messages) after you copy the object. The objects in the ready-made stacks are designed to avoid this problem.
