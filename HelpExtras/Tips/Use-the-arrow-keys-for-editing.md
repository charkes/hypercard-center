### Use the arrow keys for editing

Normally, the arrow keys move you through cards. To use the arrow keys for moving the insertion point while editing a field, select Arrow Keys on the Preferences card in your Home stack.  

When Arrow Keys in Text is turned on, the arrow keys move you through cards unless the insertion point is in a field. Then the arrow keys move the insertion point. When the insertion point is in a field, you can hold down the Option key while you press the arrow keys to move through cards in a stack.
