### The different kinds of text

When you want to add visible text to a stack, you can choose from three different kinds of text:

* Field text * Text that’s attached to a button * Paint text

<b>Field Text </b> Field text is the best choice for most purposes. Field text is easy to edit— you can select any part of the text in a field and change it, move it, copy it, or delete it. You can move field text around by selecting and dragging the field, and you can use ` find ` to search for it.

<b>Text attached to a button </b> Although a button can’t hold much text, buttons can be useful for adding text labels to a card or background. You can move button text around by selecting and dragging the button. You can’t edit button text from the card—the text is actually the name of the button. 

<b>Paint Text </b> Paint text can’t be edited. Once you finish typing Paint text and click somewhere else, it “dries”—to change it, you have to erase it and retype it. Paint text is useful for adding a permanent label to a graphic or for creating special effects.
