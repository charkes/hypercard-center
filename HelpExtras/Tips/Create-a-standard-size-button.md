### Create a standard size button

If you hold down the Shift key while you resize a Standard, Default, or Rounded Rectangle button, HyperCard makes the button the same height as a standard Macintosh button (which is the same height as the buttons produced by the New Button command).

HyperCard automatically sizes a pop-up button to correspond to the buttonâ€™s text properties.
