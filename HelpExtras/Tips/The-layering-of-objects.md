### The layering of objects

Within the object layer of a card or background, buttons and fields overlap (appear on top of each other), depending on the order in which they were added to the card or background.

An object’s number, shown in its Info dialog box, reflects its position relative to the other objects of the same type—card button 2 is on top of card button 1, and so on. 

Additionally, an object’s part number tells the absolute layering of a button or field within its domain (card or background).  For example, if card field 1 is on top of card button 1, card field 1 has a part number of  2.

When you want to change the layering of buttons and fields within a domain, remember these points:

* Card buttons and fields always appear on
   top of the card picture.

* Background buttons and fields always 
   appear on top of the background picture.

* Card elements always appear on top of 
    background elements.

* You may have to choose Bring Closer or 
    Send Farther several times before the 
    absolute order of fields and buttons 
    changes.  While the part number of the 
    object changes each time you choose 
    Bring Closer or Send Farther, there may 
    be objects of another type that you need 
    to get past before the change of order 
    becomes visually apparent.
