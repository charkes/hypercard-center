### Where should I put the field?

When you add a field to a stack, you need to decide whether you want to put it on the card layer or the background layer:

*	If you want the field and its text to 
   appear only on one card, put the field in 
   the card layer. 

* If you want the field to appear on every 
   card in the stack, but you want to be able 
   to type different text into the field on 
   each card, put the field in the 
   background layer.

*	If you want the field to appear on every 
   card in the stack, and you want it to 
   display the same text on each card, put 
   the field in the background layer and 
   turn on the Shared Text option in the 
   Field Info dialog box. 

*	If you want a field to appear on some of 
   the cards in the stack, but not all of them,
   create a different background for those 
   cards and put the field in just that 
    background.
