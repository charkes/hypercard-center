### Turn off Fixed Line Height

If you set varying text sizes within a field, make sure the Fixed Line Height check box in its Field Info dialog box is not checked. Turning off Fixed Line Height lets HyperCard adjust the line height of each line in a field to fit different sizes of text.  

(To open the Field Info dialog box, select a field and choose Field Info from the Objects menu. You must set your user level to Authoring to see the Objects menu.)
