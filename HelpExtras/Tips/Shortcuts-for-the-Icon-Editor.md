### Shortcuts for the Icon Editor

You can use the following shortcuts while youâ€™re editing icons in the Icon Editor (in addition to the Command-key equivalents in the menus):

* To go to the first icon,    press Command-Left Arrow.

* To go to the previous icon,    press` `Left Arrow.

* To go to the next icon,    press` `Right Arrow.

* To go to the last icon,    press Command-Right Arrow.

* To clear (remove) the current icon,    press` `Command-Delete.

* To select part of the icon picture, hold     down Command, and drag. You can move, copy,     cut, and apply effects to the selection.     (Press and hold the Shift key to     constrain movement to vertical and     horizontal directions.)

* To peel off a copy of the selection, hold      down the Option key, and drag.

* To paste just the icon picture after     copying or cutting an icon (instead of     creating a new icon), press Command-Option-V.

* The following power keys work in the     Icon Editor, both on the entire icon and      on the current selection (except as     noted):

   `Erase               E (selection only) `   `Frame               F `   `Flip Horizontal     H `   `Flip Vertical       V `   `Gray                G `   `Invert              I `   `Mirror Horizontal   M `   `Mirror Vertical     X `   `Opaque              O (selection only) `   `Revert              R `   `Rotate Left         [ `   `Rotate Right        ] `   `Shadow              S (icon only) `   `Transparent         T (selection only) `   `Undo                Esc or ~`
