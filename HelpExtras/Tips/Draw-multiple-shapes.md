### Draw multiple shapes

If you want to draw many nested shapes with a single drag, choose Draw Multiple from the Options menu (or press M if the Power Keys option is turned on) before drawing them.  

Hide the Message box and then press Option-1 through Option-9 to increase or decrease the amount of space that appears between the multiple images.

Note: Draw Multiple has no effect when you use the Polygon tool.
