### expression

<b>HyperTalk Definition</b>

Any HyperTalk expression. All expressions evaluate to text, a number, or a constant.  

For example:

```
true
sin(90)
"this is" && it
(3+2) = 5
the heapspace div 1024
```

Note: Formally, HyperCard distinguishes between factors (simple values) and expressions. The difference between factors and expressions matters only if you like to drop parentheses. Most functions take factors as their parameters, which is why `length of 3 + 5` returns `6` and `length of (3 + 5)` returns `1`. In short, always use parentheses to group things the way you want them to evaluate, and you wonâ€™t have to worry about the difference between factors and expressions.

<b>AppleScript Definition</b>

Any series of words that has a value.
