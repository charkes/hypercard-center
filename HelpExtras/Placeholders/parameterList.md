### parameterList

A comma-separated list of local variable names. 

The actual names don’t matter as long as they’re not the same as one of HyperCard’s reserved words. (That is, don’t use `result` as a variable name.) For example:

```
var1
var1,var2,var3, var4
fieldName, N, numberOfCharacters
```
