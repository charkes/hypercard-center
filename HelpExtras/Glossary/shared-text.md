### shared text

Text that appears in the same field on every card of a background; an option in the Field Info dialog box that allows a field to display shared text.

When the Shared Text option is turned on for a field, you can enter or edit text in the field only while you’re in the [g:background layer].

In general, it’s better to use shared text than to use Paint text  because shared text is editable, and Paint text is not.
