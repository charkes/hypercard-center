### Scripting

User level 5, the highest of HyperCard’s five user levels. 

At this user level, you can do the same things you can do at the Authoring level—plus write and edit [g:script]s and set the [g:Blind Typing] option.

See also: [g:Browsing], [g:Typing], [g:Painting], [g:Authoring], [g:user level].
