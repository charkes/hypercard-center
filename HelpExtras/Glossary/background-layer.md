### background layer

The layer behind the [g:card layer], containing all the elements of the [g:background]. Also called the background domain.

You see the elements of both layers when you look at a [g:card], as if the card layer were a transparent layer in front of the background layer. The [g:background button] or [g:background field] created most recently is ordinarily the topmost object in the background layer (that is, closest within the background layer to the front of the screen). The [g:background picture] is behind (farther from the front of the screen) the objects in the background layer.
