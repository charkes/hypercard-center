### Typing

User level 2 of HyperCard’s five user levels.  

At this user level, you can do all the same things you can do at the Browsing level—plus type, edit, and style text in existing fields, add and delete cards, compact stacks, and set the [g:Arrow Keys in Text] option.

See also: [g:Browsing], [g:Painting], [g:Authoring], [g:Scripting], [g:user level].
