### palette

A small window that displays commands, icons, or patterns the user can select by clicking. 

You can see two of HyperCard’s palettes, the Tools palette and the Patterns palette,  by “tearing off” their respective menus. To see the navigator palette, type 

                        `palette navigator ` into the Message box, and press Return. ( If  you’re using the Home stack that came with HyperCard, you can  type ` nav` ` `instead.`)

`Stacks may have their own custom palettes as well.
