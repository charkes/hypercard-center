### background

A type of HyperCard [g:object]; a template shared by a number of cards. 

Each card with the same background has the same [g:background picture], [g:background field]s, and [g:background button]s in its [g:background layer]. As do other HyperCard objects, every background has a script. You can place handlers in a background script that you want to be accessible to all the cards with that background.
