### Painting

User level 3 of HyperCard’s five user levels. 

At this user level, you can do the same things you can do at the Typing level—plus create and edit graphics with the Paint tools (in the Tools menu), set the [g:Power Keys] option, set stack protection, delete stacks, and move between the background layer and the card layer.

See also: [g:Browsing], [g:Typing], [g:Authoring], [g:Scripting], [g:user level].
