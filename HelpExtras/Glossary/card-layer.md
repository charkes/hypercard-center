### card layer

The layer in front of the [g:background layer]. Also called the card domain.

You see the elements of both layers when you look at a [g:card], as if the card layer were a transparent layer in front of the background layer. 

The [g:card button] or [g:card field] created most recently is ordinarily the topmost object in the card layer (that is, closest within the card layer to the front of the screen). The [g:card picture] is behind (farther from the front of the screen) the objects in the card layer. All elements in the card layer are in front of elements in the background layer.
