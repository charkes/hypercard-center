### locked stack

A stack that can’t be changed.

A padlock appears after the last menu title in the menu bar of a locked stack.

A stack can be locked for any of a number of reasons:

* Can’t Modify Stack is selected in the 
   Protect Stack dialog box.
* Locked is selected in the stack’s Get Info 
    box in the Finder.
* The medium that holds the stack is 
    read only—a locked disk, a CD-ROM, or
    a locked folder on a file server.
* The stack was written using an outdated 
    version of HyperCard.
