### button

A type of HyperCard [g:object]; a “hot spot” on a card or background that you can click to make something happen. 

For example, clicking a right arrow button with the Browse tool can take you to the next card.

HyperCard has two kinds of buttons—[g:card button]s and [g:background button]s.
