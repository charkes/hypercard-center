### Paint text

Text you type using the Paint Text tool. 

Paint text can appear anywhere;  [g:field text] must appear in a field created with the Field tool. 

When you finalize Paint text by clicking, it becomes part of a card or background picture; the only way to edit it is to erase it and start over. 

Unlike field text, Paint text cannot be searched.
