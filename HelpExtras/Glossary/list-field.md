### list field

A field from which a user can make choices.

When a user clicks a line or, if Multiple Lines is checked, drags through a series of lines in a list field, the lines are highlighted. A script can detect the highlighted lines and take appropriate action.

A list field has its Lock Text, Auto Select, and Don't Wrap (and optionally, Multiple Lines) choices checked in the Field Info dialog box.
