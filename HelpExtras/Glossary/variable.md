### variable

A named container that can hold a [g:value] of any length (depending on the available memory). 

You can create a variable to hold some value (either numbers or text) simply by using its name with the `put` command and putting the value into it.

A [ph:local variable]  retains its value only within the handler that uses it; a [ph:global variable]  retains its value across all handlers in which itâ€™s declared.
