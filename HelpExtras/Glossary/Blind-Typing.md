### Blind Typing

An option available on the Preferences card of the Home stack when your user level is [g:Scripting] (5). 

When this option is turned on, you can type in the [g:Message box] even when it’s hidden (as long as the insertion point isn’t in a field). 

When the Blind Typing option is turned off, you can type in the Message box only when you see it on the screen; HyperCard beeps (or the menu bar flashes) if you try to type in the Message box when it’s hidden. 

See also: [g:Arrow Keys in Text], [g:Power Keys].
