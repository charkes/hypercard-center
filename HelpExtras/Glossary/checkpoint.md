### checkpoint

A specific place in a script where HyperCard suspends execution of a handler and enters its debugging environment.

You set[ph:temporary]  checkpoints by holding down the Option key and clicking a line in the active Script Editor window. A check mark appears beside a line to indicate the checkpoint. Temporary checkpoints are not saved with a scriptâ€”you lose them when you quit HyperCard.

You set <b>permanent</b> checkpoints by placing the `debug checkPoint` command as one of the statements in a script.
