### Arrow Keys in Text

An option available on the Preferences card of the Home stack when your user level is 2 ([g:Typing]) or higher.

When this option is turned off, the arrow keys on the keyboard move you through cards in a stack. 

When this option is turned on[ph:and ] the insertion point is blinking in a field or in the Message box, the arrow keys move the insertion point through textâ€”just as they do in most word processors. The arrow keys still move you through a stack if the insertion point is not in a field or the Message box.
