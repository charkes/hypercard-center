### Power Keys

Option that lets you use specific keys on the keyboard to make changes to graphics.

When Power Keys is turned on, pressing a single key substitutes for choosing a menu command that affects the selected graphic (or the graphic element youâ€™ve just created).

The Power Keys option is available on the Preferences card of the Home stack when your user level is [g:Painting] (3) or higher and in the Options menu when a Paint tool is selected.
