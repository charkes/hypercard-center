### card

A type of HyperCard [g:object]; a rectangular area that can hold buttons, fields, and graphics. All cards in a [g:stack] are the same size. 

Each card is a composite of two layersâ€”a foreground layer, called the [g:card layer], and the [g:background layer]. You see the elements of both layers when you look at a card, as if the card layer were a transparent layer in front of the background layer. Each layer can contain its own buttons, fields, and graphics.
