### Where’s the field?

A transparent empty field is invisible unless the Field tool is selected. This makes it difficult to locate the field when you’re ready to enter text into it. To locate the field on a card

* Move the Browse tool around—the Browse tool turns into an I-beam when it’s over an editable field. 

* Press Tab repeatedly. This sets the insertion point in the editable fields on the current card and background, one at a time.  

* Press Command-Shift-Option. This tells HyperCard to peek at both buttons and fields. Their rectangles are outlined with gray borders.
