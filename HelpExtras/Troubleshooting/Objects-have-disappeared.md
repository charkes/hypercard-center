### Objects have disappeared

When you reduce the size of a stack’s cards, HyperCard doesn’t move buttons, fields, or graphics to fit within the new size. But the original elements still exist, even if you can’t see them. You can retrieve buttons and fields any time by enlarging the cards to their former size.

You can retrieve graphics until you edit them with the Paint tools. If you need to retrieve graphics after resizing cards, enlarge the cards immediately, before using any of the Paint tools.
