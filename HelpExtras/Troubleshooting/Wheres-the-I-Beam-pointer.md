### Where’s the I-Beam pointer?

If the Browse tool doesn’t turn into an I-beam when you move it over a field, the reason could be any of the following:

* Your user level is set to Browsing.

* The field is locked.

* The text you’re trying to edit is either Paint text or the name of a button—not field text.

*	The Shared Text option is turned on in the field’s Field Info dialog box. You can edit shared text only when you’re in the background layer.

*	The Shared Text option is not turned on in the field’s Field Info dialog box, and you’re working in the background layer. You can add normal field text (text that isn’t shared) only while you’re in the card layer.
