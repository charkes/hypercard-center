### Where are the menus?

If you can’t see any of the menus at the top of the screen, press Command–Space bar to make the menu bar appear.

If you don’t see a specific menu, such as the Tools, Objects, Paint, Options, or Patterns menu, your user level is probably set too low.

* The Tools menu appears when your user level is Painting or higher.

* The Objects menu appears when your user level is Authoring or higher.

* The Paint, Options, and Patterns menus appear only when you’ve chosen one of the Paint tools from the Tools menu.
