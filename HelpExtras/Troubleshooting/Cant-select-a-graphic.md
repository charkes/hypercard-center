### Can’t select a graphic

If you’ve selected a graphic with the Selection tool, but you can’t drag it, or if you try to select a graphic with the Lasso tool, but nothing happens, then

* The graphic might be an icon that belongs to a button.

* You might be trying to select a background picture without being in the background. Choose Background from the Edit menu (or press Command-B), and try again.
