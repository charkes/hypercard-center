### Got a card object by mistake

The most common mistake in creating a button or a field is putting it on a card when it’s supposed to be in the background.

After you’ve created a new field or button, go to the next card. If the object appears on this card too, then you’ve created it in the background.

Otherwise, it’s on the card, and you might want to move it to the background. (Use Cut and Paste to do it.)
