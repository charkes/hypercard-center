### Where’s the Objects menu?

* Can you see the menu bar at all? Press  Command-Space bar to show and hide the   menu bar.

* Is your user level set to Authoring or     Scripting? If not, set it from the     Preferences card in the Home stack. 

* Are you using a Paint tool?  If you have     a Paint tool selected, the Objects menu is     replaced by the Paint, Options, and     Patterns menus. Choose the Browse tool     to get the Objects menu back.
