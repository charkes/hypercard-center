### Can’t find a menu command

* If you can’t find a menu command in the File or Edit menu, your user level is probably set too low. For example, the Protect Stack and Delete Stack commands appear in the File menu only when your user level is set to Painting or higher. (You can access the full File menu even when your user level is lower than Painting by holding down the Command key while you pull down the menu.)

* If your user level is set to Painting or higher, the Compact Stack, Protect Stack, and Delete Stack commands will not appear when you are using one of the Paint tools. Choose the Browse tool from the Tools menu.

* The Import Paint and Export Paint commands appear only when you’ve chosen one of the Paint tools.
